Social mediaâ€™s rise as an accessible medium for political discourse has reshaped voter engagement and ideological divides, particularly during electoral cycles. This project examines sentiment trends surrounding the 2024 United States presidential election by analyzing social media posts from Instagram and X, formerly Twitter.

## Project Overview

The analysis utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including:

- Sentiment Analysis
- Topic Modeling
- Geographic Sentiment Mapping

These methods assessed how political discourse evolved on both platforms before and after the election.

## Dataset

A dataset comprising over 50,000 social media posts was collected using automated web scraping techniques. Sentiment analysis was performed using two main NLP tools:

- Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER)
- TextBlob

## Key Findings

- Instagram primarily acted as a platform for voter mobilization and civic engagement.
- X exhibited moderate polarization and more reactionary discourse.
- Pre-election sentiment was predominantly neutral or positive, reflecting civic enthusiasm.
- Post-election sentiment experienced sharper shifts, particularly across partisan strongholds and swing states.
- Geospatial sentiment trends were more stable in states aligned with the actual election outcomes.

## Implications

This research highlights social media's influential role in shaping public perception and reveals notable platform-specific differences in user engagement and sentiment distribution. Findings suggest that algorithmic amplification and digital environments significantly affect voter sentiments, providing insights beyond traditional polling methods.
